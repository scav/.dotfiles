# dotfiles

Contains my dotfiles for the following 
- Brewfile (all brew packages to install)
- zsh
- git
- alacritty
- tmux
- nvim

### Setup a new machine
To setup a new machine run `zsh setup.sh --init` to get all the starting stuff going.

### Daily usage
Two commands are useful

- `dotlink`: link new (and old) .dotfiles 
- `dotbrew`: update all brew packages
